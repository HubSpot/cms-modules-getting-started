# Getting Started with Modules

A starting point for building modules on the HubSpot CMS.

## Purpose

The Getting Started with Modules tutorial provides developers with clear guidelines on how to create and edit custom modules both in the [Design Manager](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/developer-reference/design-manager) and in a local environment. The tutorial also details how to include custom modules in templates and create HubSpot pages from those templates.

## Getting started

To begin, simply navigate to the [Getting Started with Modules](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-modules) tutorial. The tutorial requires you to download the [HubSpot CMS Boilerplate theme](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate). This theme is designed to offer developers a head start in the website building process. The boilerplate also represents HubSpot's [opinionated best practices](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/building-blocks/themes/hubspot-cms-boilerplate).

Because the boilerplate theme's code may change over time, we have decided to include only those files in the theme that developers will need to create or edit during the Getting Started with Modules Tutorial. These files include:

1. Testimonial.module - the folder containing the files that make up the custom module we will build as part of the tutorial.
2. homepage.html - the template that we will be editing to include our custom module.
